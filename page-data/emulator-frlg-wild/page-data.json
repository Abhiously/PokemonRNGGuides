Hit Go and you'll be done!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Vk4zYMm.png\"></p>\n<p>The \"1330\" is my seed for this run of FRLG. It changes after pressing A / Start in the main screen. There's no real way to manipulate it for the moment, so you must go with what you have.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Find a target spread</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Enter it in the \"Seed (Hex)\" box in RNG Reporter.</li>\n<li>Enter in your target settings for the Pokemon you wish to search for (shiny, IVs, nature, encounter slots, etc)</li>\n<li>Click \"Generate\".</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LiBe4F2.png\"></p>\n<p>If your RNG Reporter is setup correctly, it'll look similar to the above. In my case, I just searched for Shiny Only.</p>\n<h2>Step 5: Setup in the game</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Get to the start menu as fast as possible.</li>\n<li>Choose the Pokemon with Sweet Scent.</li>\n<li>Pause the emulator with the cursor hovering over the Sweet Scent move.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>Note: Don't hesitate to overuse save states! It's really important! This way you can go back to lower frames, and adjust correctly since calibration will be necessary EVERY TIME!\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Step 6: Calibration</h2>\n<p>In Gen 3, you'll never hit what you want at the first try. Calibration is always necessary.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a save state.</li>\n<li>Write the current frame down.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the battle by holding the A button and unpausing the game.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This will trigger the battle on the actual frame. It is really important to be holding A as you unpause the game for precision.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Check the stats of the wild Pokemon you've found in the lua script.</li>\n<li>Enter the Pokemon's stats into RNG Reporter and find the frame of the Pokemon you encountered.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find the amount of frames you were off by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Frame you pressed A) - (Frame you got from reporter)</li>\n<li>It'll be a negative result around 90% of the time, but that's normal.</li>\n<li>For example if someone pressed A on frame 100 and the hit Pokemon was frame 103, you were off by -3 frames.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add the number of frames you were off to your original frame.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you had a negative number, subtract it from your original frame.</li>\n<li>This new number is the new frame you should press <code>A</code> on.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Reload your state you did before in order to be able to continue your RNG.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>Note: You can calibrate when you want. For fast targets (aka not going for millions frames) doing it NEAR your Shiny frame will help to have a good delay. Doing it too early could give you a delay too low around your frame, and cause you to calibrate again.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>If you didn't hit what you wanted after calibration, just retry the calibration part.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use save-states done before to avoid any problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After a few tries if you still can't hit anything double check your setup.</p>\n<p>If you followed all steps, the Pokemon will be what you wanted after calibration. Tada, you did your Gen 3 Wild RNG!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"FRLG Wild RNG","description":"The most basic RNG in Gen 3"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"emulator-frlg-wild"}}}
