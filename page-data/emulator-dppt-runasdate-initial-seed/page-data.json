This guide is just explaining how to hit your Seed. It is necessary to have your target seed and delay before following this guide.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Tools</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/run_as_date.html\">RunAsDate</a> : Take care to choose the right version (32 or 64 bits) for your computer.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://pokerng.forumcommunity.net/?t=56443955&#x26;p=396434984\">Lua Scripts for Gen 4</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is RunAsDate?</h3>\n<p>RunAsDate is a tool developed by nirsoft that allows any program to load with a set time specified by the user. This tool is really usefull for Gen 4 RNG, and can be your best ally in order to hit your Seed without too much difficulty. Of course there are other ways, but this guide will only focus on RunAsDate.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Setup RunAsDate</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Launch RunAsDate</li>\n<li>Configure RunAsDate to look like the image below\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HeUoPmv.png\"></li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>Note: You'll never have to change that after. This is the universal RunAsDate configuration for RNG (Gen 3, 4 or 5), so you're almost done!\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Select the program you want to fake the date/time, with the \"Browse...\" button</li>\n<li>Set the day/time you've got in order to hit your seed</li>\n<li>After that, just hit \"Run\" and your desmume should be launched.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 2: Hitting the target seed</h2>\n<pre><code>Note: Make save states often during this process.\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Click <code>A</code> to get to the \"Continue\" screen as fast as possible.</li>\n<li>Pause your emulator <code>Ctrl + P</code>.</li>\n<li>Make plenty of save states in case you mess up.</li>\n<li>Unpause your game, and let it run until you get close to your target seed.</li>\n<li>Once you are close, pause your emulator.</li>\n<li>Create another save state (you never know what might happen!).</li>\n<li>Press <code>N</code> to advance the game one frame to increase the delay one time.</li>\n<li>Once you're close to the target delay, hold <code>A</code> while unpausing your game.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you'll find that even though you're pressing A on the right delay, the actual delay you hit is +/-1 of what you wanted. This is to be expected because of how Gen 4 delays can either be always odd or always even. There are two methods to switch delays from even to odd or vice versa listed below:</p>\n<p>It's not an error from your part, and is related to odd/even numbers. Nothing too hard to fix! You have two solutions in order to hit your right seed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changing the year: This is a simple method with RunAsDate. You just have to close your emulator (assuming you did enough saves states, and that's why it was important to do a LOT of them), and change the year in RunAsDate from +/- 1 year. Take care through, because the delay will of course change to +/-1 from your original delay! You can verify the new delay with RNG Reporter in the \"seed to time\" tab. Once you've adjusted everything, relaunch your desmume with RunAsDate and load a state, and redo the process.</li>\n<li>Load a GBA game : Doing that will just switch odd/even seed and so will correct this problem, making it easier since it's just a simple configuration and no new delay to hit again.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Initial Seed RNG (RunAsDate edition)","description":"How to control Gen 4 initial seeds without any difficulty"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"emulator-dppt-runasdate-initial-seed"}}}
