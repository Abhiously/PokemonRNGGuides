The only way to reach the frames you want is to accept and/or reject however many eggs it takes to reach those frames. However, without using the Masuda Method and without having the Shiny Charm, the ESVs are not generated until the moment you accept the egg. This means ANY egg frame can be ANY ESV you want it to be.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Note:\" data-meta=\"ESV is short for Egg Shiny Value.
