It is not possible to hit anything lower.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 3: Finding the Delay you need to hit</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You may notice that the seed listed is significantly shorter than normal Generation 5 seeds.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unfortunately, you still need to hit the Initial Seed (The 32 Digit one)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Right Click your selected spread and hit <code>Generate Entralink Nature Seeds</code></li>\n<li>Choose a list of natures that you desire</li>\n<li>Click <code>Generate</code></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 4: Hitting C-Gear Seed and Initial Seed</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the text where it says <code>[Player] warped to the Entralink!</code> and make a save state. Pause the game and note the delay.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will be finding out how long it takes for the C-Gear Seed to generate after pressing A.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Press \"A\" and in the output, the lua will tell us what the C-Gear Seed we hit was.</li>\n<li>Go back to RNG Reporter and go to Generation 5 Tools > Seed To Time</li>\n<li>Type in the C-Gear Seed you got.</li>\n<li>Subtract the Delay where you pressed A from the Delay you hit when the C-Gear Seed was generated.</li>\n<li>Now take the result and subtract the result from your target delay. For example, if my target delay was 4288 and the difference was 200, I would hit delay 4088.</li>\n<li>Hit your Initial Seed again and do Delay advances. You can inch closer by pressing N, which will add 1 to the delay.</li>\n<li>If you failed, just try again. Sometimes you think you hit it, but there was a small gap between when you unpause the emulator and press A.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 5: Advancing frames</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure to pay attention to the <strong>IVRNG Frame</strong>!</li>\n<li>Subtract <strong>13</strong> from your target frame. You will be advancing frames until you hit that.</li>\n<li>You advance frames by walking around. Make sure to only have 1 Pokemon in your party, or else it will advance too many frames at once.</li>\n<li>When you hit your IVRNG Frame, interact with your target Pokemon immediately. Make a save state and enter the battle.</li>\n<li>If you did it correctly, you will get the correct IVs on your target. Yay!</li>\n<li>To get your Nature, you can either move onto Step 6 or reload the Save State and re-catch the Pokemon.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>Note: Make sure to hit a different PIDRNG Frame each time or you will end up getting the same nature\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Step 6: Getting a good Nature</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go back to RNG Reporter and go to Entralink Seed Search. Notice the Frame.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That is the PIDRNG Frame you need to hit.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Go back to your save state and wait until you are 6 before the frame listed in RNG Reporter.</li>\n<li>Then enter the battle again and catch the Pokemon.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>Note: Make sure to have the correct Gender ratio set up!\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Congrats!</h3>\n<p>You have just completed your Entralink RNG!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Entralink","description":"How to RNG cool Pokemon with Entralink RNG"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"emulator-bw-entralink"}}}
