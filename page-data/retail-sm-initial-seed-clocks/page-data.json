This seed can then be used to RNG abuse wild encounters, events, in-game gifts, etc.</p>\n<p>At the \"Continue\" screen of the game, before your character picture loads, you can see a clock. Thanks to the clock needles position, we are going to be able to find our initial seed. The idea is to check a certain number of clocks (between 8 and 10), without restarting the game, in order to get the seed value.</p>\n<p>Since each seed is generated when you launch the game, checking the clocks needs to be done without restarting the game. You can simply leave the \"Continue\" screen by pressing <strong>B</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nh45HB.gif\"></p>\n<h2>Step 1: Setup 3DSRNGTool</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the 3DSRNGTool you downloaded.</li>\n<li>Select your game version on the top right. (\"Sun\", \"Moon\", \"Ultra Sun\" or \"Ultra Moon\").</li>\n<li>Go to \"Tools\" > \"Gen 7 Main RNG Tool\". It looks like the following picture.\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YZiTi7s.png\"></li>\n<li>Make sure that in the <code>InputBox</code> you have the option <code>End Position</code> selected with the number <code>4</code>.</li>\n<li>Select the <code>Find Initial Seed via clock hands</code> option as well.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 2: Recording the clock needles</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Boot your 3DS and open the game. Leave it on the \"Press Start\" screen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can leave the animations playing, they do not influence the seed (or the frames).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Start recording your 3DS with your camera.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Press <strong>A</strong> or <strong>Start</strong> to go into the \"Continue\" screen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you recorded the whole clock movement: from the moment you enter the \"Continue\" screen, until your character picture is displayed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Press <strong>B</strong> to go back to the \"Press Start\" screen.</li>\n<li>Repeat this process of alternating between the \"Press Start\" and the \"Continue\" screen until you get 10 clock movements.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 3: Finding the seed</h2>\n<p>Once you have recorded the 10 clock movements we need to list them in the tool to get the initial seed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the <code>InputBox</code> select the clock that corresponds to the final position of each clock.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This End Position occurs right before the picture loads.</li>\n<li>The End Position of the gif showed at the beginning is last option of the Gen7 Main RNG Tool.</li>\n<li>You will see a number appear in the <code>Needle List</code> of the tool (12 for the gif demo).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The tool will try to find your seed after you have input 8 Needle positions.\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/X4Tekx5.png\"></li>\n<li>\n<p>Sometimes you will get various results with only 8 Needles, that is why we checked 10 clocks. Enter the remaining 2 until you see a single seed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The last 2 Needle positions are also useful to confirm your seed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you do not have any results try checking your video again and see where you made a mistake on the Needle positions.</li>\n<li>If you still do not find any results, restart the game and try again recording 10 new clocks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your seed should appear in the <code>Results</code> field if you did everything correctly.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finding your initial seed in Gen 7 with clocks","description":"This guide allows you to find your initial seed without using Custom Firmware"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"retail-sm-initial-seed-clocks"}}}
