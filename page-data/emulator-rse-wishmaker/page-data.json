It may take many tries to obtain your Jirachi because of this.\n\nIt is not possible to RNG for a specific Jirachi spread with this method. This guide is only for RNGing a shiny Jirachi and you cannot choose a specific spread. Manipulating the block 0 checksum for a specific Jirachi spread is a complex process and is not covered in this guide.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Step 1: Setting up</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Find your save delay</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before beginning this process you need to find your save delay.</li>\n<li>Start by opening up Ruby/Sapphire on VBA-RR and load the wishmaker lua script.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open up the save menu and pause the game at the last line of dialogue over \"YES\".</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make note of the current time displayed by the lua script.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Next, hold down the <code>A</code> button and unpause the game at the same time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watch the current time. When the current time on the lua script freezes, pause the game and write that time down.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is an example of the time freezing while saving.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dVM5jnp.gif\"></p>\n<p>Your save delay will be the time when it froze minus the time when you paused the game before saving.</p>\n<p><code>Save delay = time froze - time paused</code></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<p>Open up the lua script in a text editor, such as wordpad.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put your save delay second and frame in the variables \"savedelaySecond\" and \"savedelayFrame\".</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>Note: Make sure not to modify anything in the lua script below the \"DON'T EDIT ANYTHING BEYONG HERE\" comment!\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SfM5d39.png\"></p>\n<h2>Step 2: Finding a Jirachi seed</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Prepare the save</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must use a save that has already obtained the Pokedex.</li>\n<li>After obtaining the Pokedex, save your game.</li>\n<li>In VBA-RR, export your battery file and upload it to wishmaker-calc by clicking the Jirachi.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the website tells you to save the game again, do so and reupload the save to the website.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This may happen multiple times.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vDfWBpb.png\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<p>If the website displays \"No Results\" you have a few options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can move to a different location, save, and check for a Jirachi again.</li>\n<li>Collecting the Running Shoes, or doing wild battles may also work.</li>\n<li>If you're still getting \"No Results\", then you will have to either wait 30 minutes ingame, or restart the game with a new save.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>Note: The program searches through the next 30 minutes only for a match which is why waiting 30 minutes ingame may allow for new results to be found.\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<p>If you get a time to save, you have found a Jirachi.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the spread to see if it is one you want. If it isn't, repeat the above steps.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5gZ1w80.png\"></p>\n<h2>Step 3: Hitting the Target Seed</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the lua script in wordpad (or your favorite text editor).</li>\n<li>\n<p>Input the time given by wishmaker-calc under targetSaveHour, Minute, Second, and sixtiethSecond.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optionally, you can add your target Jirachi seed as well (for rng proofs/personal preference).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Restart the lua script.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will notice that there are now two different times displayed in the lua script.</li>\n<li>The target save time is the time to save at to obtain the desired Jirachi.</li>\n<li>The real save time is the time you will actually be saving at and was calculated using your save delay.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>Note: Target save time = Real save time + delay while saving\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Advance to the last dialogue of the save menu and hover over \"YES\".</li>\n<li>Pause the game here.</li>\n<li>Wait for the ingame time to match the real save time displayed.</li>\n<li>Unpause the game and wait until you are close to the time needed.</li>\n<li>Once you are close to your real save time, pause the game and advance frames manually.</li>\n<li>The default key for advancing frames while paused is <code>Ctrl + N</code> for Windows.</li>\n<li>When you are on your real save time, hold down <code>A</code> and unpause the game at the same time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Sl0KWy1.png\"></p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>After saving the game, export your battery file.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 4: Verifying Target Seed</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Upload your save to wishmaker-calc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It should display a message to save your game again, but you can disregard it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Next to the save your game message there should be text that says \"Current checksum:\".</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the seed next to it matches any of the <a href=\"https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/rdxEbTm4/\">shiny Jirachi seeds</a> then congrats! Your save will redeem to a shiny Jirachi!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vDfWBpb.png\"></p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n<p>If your block 0 checksum does not match one of the shiny Jirachi seeds, you will need to restart the process from the beginning.</p>\n<p>As mentioned previously, some bytes of game data that wishmaker calc does not account for might have caused the method to fail.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you might have saved at the wrong time or obtained your save delay incorrectly.</p>\n<h2>Methods to redeem Jirachi</h2>\n<p>You can redeem your Jirachi by moving your save file to a real cartridge and using a real bonus disc, or by emulating the bonus disc with dolphin.</p>\n<p>A guide on connecting VBA to Dolphin can be found <a href=\"https://pokemonrng.com/guides/tools/en/How%20to%20Connect%20Dolphin%20to%20VBA/\">here</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to RNG Shiny WISHMKR Jirachi using wishmaker-calc","description":"Unlimited Shiny Jirachis"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"emulator-rse-wishmaker"}}}
