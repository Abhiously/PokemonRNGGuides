This allows inifinite retries in case you miss the RNG.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Callibrate your delay</h2>\n<p>Like most games, RNGing with Transporter will have a delay between the time a user presses \"A\" and the time the Pokemon are generated/transferred. Transporter's delay is partially caused by network requests to the validation and Bank servers, so the delay will always need to be callibrated before RNGing with Transporter.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you have at least one Pokemon in Box 1, Slot 1 of your Gen 1/2 game</li>\n<li>Load Pokemon Transporter with PCalc on your 3ds</li>\n<li>Open up 3DSRNGTool on your computer</li>\n<li>Change 3DSRNGTool's \"Game Version\" to \"Transporter\"</li>\n<li>Change 3DSRNGTool's \"Seed\" to the Initial Seed PCalc shows you</li>\n<li>Change 3DSRNGTool's tab to \"Stationary RNG\"</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Transporter, press \"Start\" to select the game you would like to use with Transporter</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the final \"A\" press before Pokemon are generated</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Press \"Start + Select\" to pause the game</li>\n<li>Make a note of your current frame, this is your starting frame</li>\n<li>Press \"A\" to unpause and have Transporter generate the Pokemon</li>\n<li>Search for the exact IVs PCalc says the generated Pokemon has using 3DSRNGTool to find your hit frame</li>\n<li>\n<p>Subtract your hit frame from your starting frame to get your delay</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Example: I started on frame 1000 and I hit frame 1197, so my delay is 197</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When asked to transfer the Pokemon, click \"No\"</li>\n<li>Repeat the process 5-10 times to get 5-10 delays</li>\n<li>Input the most frequent delay, or an average of all delays, into 3DSRNGTool's \"Delay\" box</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 2: Find a spread to RNG</h2>\n<p>Follow these steps in 3DSRNGTool to find a desired spread:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Change the \"Gender Ratio\" to match the gender ratio of the Pokemon you’d like to RNG</li>\n<li>Change the \"Index of Target Pkm\" to be \"1\"</li>\n<li>\n<p>Change <em>only</em> the gender and IVs to find a spread you would like to hit</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nature, ability, and shininess are determined in the Gen 1/2 game before Transporter</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Change the first \"Frame Range\" box to be the frame you are currently on</li>\n<li>Change the second \"Frame Range\" box to be the maximum frame you want to search for spreads</li>\n<li>Click \"Search\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All results are potentially wanted frames.
