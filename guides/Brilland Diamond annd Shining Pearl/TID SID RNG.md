Note : If anybody helps with that guide, I've no idea of that since I don't care at all of that RNG. So yeah. Should be valid based on the infos. 

This guide will allow you to RNG the TID / SID combinaison of your choice. Both are linked, so one frame will give both TID and SID.

Requirement :
- PokeFinder Builds : https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Admiral-Fish/pokefinder
- CaptureSight

Open your game. With CaptureSight, get the states. Open PokeFinder, go to Gen 8 tab and click on TID / SID. 

Note : PokeFinder states doesn't work the same as CaptureSight because we like to make things difficult. So you'll have to enter them in this order : 
- 1st state of PokeFinder : 2nd state of CaptureSight / 1st state of CaptureSight
- 2nd state of PokeFinder : 4th state of CaptureSight / 3rd state of CaptureSight

Generate the results. Take care that it's a really slow RNG. So you'll try to avoid to go for too high frames. No delay is necessary on that RNG.

The TID / SID gets generated once pressing Yes when you validate your name. However, the states are frozen at the name screen. So pretty much, you must hit your target when you select your player's hair and stye.

To advance states, you'll have the Munchlax of the intro blinking, allowing to +1.
