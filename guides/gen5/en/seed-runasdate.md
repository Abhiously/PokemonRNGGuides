# Seed RNG (runasdate edition)
_How to control the time without any difficulty_
```
Important note : This guide assumes that you have found your Target Seed, and that you know how to do it. Same for profiles. This guide is just explaining how to hit your Seed.
```

## What is runasdate?

runasdate is a tool developped by nirsoft that allows to load any program with a specified fake time. This tool is really usefull for Gen 5 RNG, and can be your best ally in order to hit your Seed without doing anything. Of course there are other ways, but this guide will only focus on runasdate.

You can download it [here](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/run_as_date.html), but take care to choose the right version: If you have a desmume 64-bits or 32-bits, you'll have to download the matching runasdate. It's really important.

## How to setup runasdate?

Once downloaded and launched, you should have this windows :

This screenshot show runsadate once well configured. This means you'll have to uncheck ANY box, and to set to Absolute day/time (but should be set by default).

You'll never have to change that after. This is the universal runasdate configuration for RNG (Gen 3, 4 or 5), so you're almost done ! Now you just have to select the program you want to fake the date/time, with the "Browse..." button, and to set the day/time you've got in order to hit your seed.

After that, just hit "Run" and your desmume should be launched.

Congratulations, you've controled the time ! Now it's time to hit the wanted Seed.

## Hitting the target seed

On your desmume you just faked date and time, load your script.
```
Note : You'll have to use the script that shows both seeds (initial + current). You can find it [here](http://pokerng.forumcommunity.net/?t=56443955&p=396434991) and take care to download revised versions ! 
```

Now you can load your game, do the keypress(es) if necessary and you'll see that the seed is the right wanted for your target frame. There's nothing more to do, you can just continue as any basic any RNG !

### Troubleshoot

If you're not hitting the right seed at the first try with runasdate, it's 100% an user error. It can be a lot of things : Wrong time, wrong profile, wrong keypress etc... But if you have followed every step, there's no way to fail your seed.
