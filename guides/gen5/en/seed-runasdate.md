## What is runasdate?

runasdate is a tool developped by nirsoft that allows to load any program with a specified fake time. This tool is really usefull for Gen 5 RNG, and can be your best ally in order to hit your Seed without too much difficulty. Of course there are other ways, but this guide will only focus on runasdate.

You can download it [here](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/run_as_date.html), but take care to choose the right version: If you have a desmume 64-bits or 32-bits, you'll have to download the matching runasdate. It's really important.

## How to setup runasdate?

Once downloaded and launched, you should have this windows :

This screenshot show runsadate once well configured. This means you'll have to uncheck ANY box, and to set to Absolute day/time (but should be set by default).

You'll never have to change that after. This is the universal runasdate configuration for RNG (Gen 3, 4 or 5), so you're almost done ! Now you just have to select the program you want to fake the date/time, with the "Browse..." button, and to set the day/time you've got in order to hit your seed.

After that, just hit "Run" and your desmume should be launched.

Congratulations, you've controled the time ! Now it's time to hit the wanted Seed.
